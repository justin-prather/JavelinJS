This is an extraction of the Javelin front end library originally developed at Facebook, and now maintained by phacility. 
Javelin is an awesome library that is light weight and gives some much needed structure to large JS codebases. For more information on Javelin, check out https://github.com/phacility/phabricator/tree/master/webroot/rsrc/externals/javelin
This is an adaptation based on the Aphlict server used alongside Phabricator (https://www.phacility.com/) with the intention of making it easier to install and use Javelin to structure server side NodeJS code.

Install: 
`npm install javelin-js`

Use:
`var JX = require('javelin-js').JX;`
